    Hi my name is Vincent Tse and my position for this project is back-end engineer / server admin.
    This is the first time I have worked on a project this big with a group of this size so I am excited.
    I have mostly coded in C++ and Java and have a semesters worth of knowledge of Python, HTML, and CSS.
    There is going to be a lot to learn and it is going to be hard, but it will be worth it in the end to see a
    great product working with an amazing team.
    <br><br>
    When I am not working, I like to watch shows on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Some shows I have watched are nature
    documentaries like Planet Earth and Our Planet; other shows are comedy like Community and Scrubs.
