        Howdy, my name is Luke Chang-Knezevich! I'm an SF native that's working towards his
        degree in computer science at SFSU. I enjoy coding and creating all sorts of things. I'm 
        proficient in Java, CPP, and C and also have experience working with HTML, JavaScript,
        React, and CSS. My most recent endeavors include a game called GuildCat made in Godot,
        releasing for free soon, and a fluid dynamics simulator created in C. 
        <br><br>
        I also enjoy working with tools outside of the world of code. I'm well versed in using 
        Photoshop CS6 and have lots of animation experience in Flash CS3. I enjoy creating art 
        assets for various projects including animations, games, and websites.
        <br><br>
        In my spare time I enjoy playing/listening to music. I play a variety of different 
        instruments including the french horn, piano, guitar, glockenspiel, and harmonica. I'd 
        love to learn how to play the trombone and the trumpet in the future as well. I'm always 
        open to experiencing and learning new things, and this is something that I try to apply to 
        all aspects of life!
