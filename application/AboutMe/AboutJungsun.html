        Hello there. My name is Jungsun Eoh, and I go by the name June. 
        I came to the bay area 4 years ago, but I feel like I've lost one year out of 4 years. 
        I am majoring in Computer Science at San Francisco State University. This is my senior year.
        <br><br>
        I mostly coded in C++ and Java, and I enjoy solving problem to build efficient algorithm. 
        Recently, I started to learn Azure and python. This summer, my internship got canceled, 
        but I was lucky enough to get into a mentorship program. I learned product cycles and Cloud 
        computing technology, and I attended my first hackathon with this program. Right now, 
        I'm working with a mobile application project using Xamarin and C#. I enjoy learning about new technology.
        <br><br>
        When I have free time, I play video games; not hard-core game player, but I play the Elder scrolls online 
        and Apex lately. I enjoy binge-watching Netflix when I want to slack off my weekend. For the last fun 
        thing about me, I bake. I'm looking forward to baking my first (hopefully) eat-able pound cake this weekend.
