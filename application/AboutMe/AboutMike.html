          Welcome to my “About Me” page. I am a computer science major at San Francisco State University 
          that will be graduating this year with a B.S. Generally, I enjoy dealing with databases and 
          file management while attempting to make usability for the user as smooth as possible. 
          I find the best thing about being in this field is learning new things (or even relearning them) 
          and being able to improve on past projects/solutions. Lately, I have been writing in Python, SQL, 
          and a little bit of Flutter -- all for data extraction and presenting it in a readable way for others. 
          <br><br>
          Aside from this, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and hanging out with my dog. 
          Specifically, I’m currently reading the manga One Piece whenever a new chapter is released 
          every week or so. Reading through documentations is rewarding in a way that I have stumbled upon 
          something new that I could use in the future. There’s also volume 14 of Overlord that I would like 
          to read once I can free up enough time to read the whole volume through with little interruption. 
          As for video games, I am playing Monster Hunter whenever free time and the ‘want’ to play intersect. 
          I am hoping to free up some time for this when the last large update comes in October. 
          Then there’s my dog Skye. She’s pretty much the youngest sibling in the family. There are times 
          where I think she may be a cat -- best cat.
