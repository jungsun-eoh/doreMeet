          Hello, my name is Meet Patel and I was born in India, but I have been living in LA for past 9 years.
          I am trying to do minor in Mathematics, along with my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. 
          I like coding and creating Projects. I am proficient in Java, and know Basics about C++, C, and C#. 
          I also have some Knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. My most recent project that I have 
          worked on is A game, in which my role is to create an Inventory. Also, I was working on a
          desktop Application, a hotel check-in management system, Created in Java.
          <br><br>
          Besides coding, I have experience with AutoCAD. I have used it to create interior design of 
          houses. I enjoy creating interior design, and I have created many projects just because I 
          like creating interiors.
          <br><br>
          During my spare time I like to play games. I mostly play all sort of games, but the one
          that I like the most are action-adventure and first-person shooter games. My favorite games 
          are Assassin's creed and Call of duty. I also like to play games when I can’t code, it helps
          me to fresh sup my mind.
