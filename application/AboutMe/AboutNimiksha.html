        My name is Nimiksha Mahajan and I am a Senior at SF State University. I am a Computer Science major, 
        and am alaso pursuing a double minor in Information Systems and Mathematics. I am all set to 
        graduate this Fall, and start my career as a Software Engineer. 
        I am pursing CS, because I like problem solving and analyzing solutions.
        <br><br>
        As much as I enjoy coding, I also love to look at problems from a "big-picture" perspective.
        I like to think about any product/project I am workign wth from start to finish, configuring the 
        finer details, thinking about its market, collaborating woth all stakeholders, and trying to establish
        a common ground which not only serves the purpose of the product, but also brings the team on a 
        happy middle. ground. This is also why I chose to be a team lead! 
        <br><br>
        When I am not hunched over my laptop, you cna find me travelling or hiking. I love being outdoors, 
        enjoying the sun with a good book. I also love to explore cities, and find hole-in-the-wall places 
        that help me learn about the place I am visiting. And I <i>love</i> adventure sports!
